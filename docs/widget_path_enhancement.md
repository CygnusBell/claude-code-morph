# Widget Path Enhancement

## Overview
The `get_widget_info` method in `BasePanel` has been enhanced to show the complete DOM path of widgets, making it easier to understand the widget hierarchy and debug layout issues.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced `get_widget_info` Method
The method now:
1. Traverses up the widget hierarchy to build a complete DOM path
2. Shows each widget in the path with its class name, ID (if present), and CSS classes
3. Includes widget dimensions and position information
4. Returns a multi-line formatted string for better readability

### Example Output
When hovering over a button, you might see:
```
Path: ClaudeCodeMorph > Screen > TestPanel > Vertical > Horizontal#button-row.button-container > Button#submit-btn.primary.action
Size: 10x3
Position: (5, 10)
```

### Updated Widget Label Display
- The widget label now uses the enhanced path information
- CSS updated to support multi-line display with proper formatting
- Increased padding and max-width for better readability

## Usage
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+L` to toggle widget labels
2. Hover over any widget to see its full DOM path and information
3. The path shows the complete hierarchy from the app root down to the widget

## Testing
Run the test script to see the enhancement in action:
```bash
python test_widget_path.py
```

This will create a test app with various nested widgets. Enable widget labels and hover over different elements to see their paths.
