Test content for clipboard operations.

If you can copy this text, then clipboard is working!

Try these keyboard shortcuts in the app:
- Cmd+C (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+C (Linux/Windows): Copy selected text
- Cmd+Shift+C: Copy all panel content

The app also saves copied content to:
/home/kruger/projects/claude-code-morph/claude_code_morph/clipboard.txt
